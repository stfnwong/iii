### A Ternary logic library.

Originally this was going to be the start of a Ternary MIPS implementation. I since realised that I probably need to get to grips with a binary MIPS implementation first (which is what SMIPS is supposed to be).

## Feature
- Can compute Ternary logic
- Not that fast
- No special optimiziations

At some point, once I have some chip emulations or RTL or whatever I will come back to this and create some kind of Ternary chip.
